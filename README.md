===============
This is my public repository (castle) of dotfiles to be used with [Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick)


.bashrc and .bashrc.d
---------------------
.bashrc has been split out into a number of files under .bashrc.d and gets executed in alphabetical order.  Filenames must in end .bash and be executable (which allows a quick way to disable files)
